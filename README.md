# SFFoodFinder

This is a CLI app for finding places to eat in San Francisco.  Recommendations are currently limited to food trucks & push carts, but could be expanded to include restaurants at a later time.  This app uses a CSV, which is a [data dump of food truck & push cart permits](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data) from [DataSF](https://data.sfgov.org/), so the recommendations are fixed.  The next logical step would be to switch from using the fixed CSV to integrating data from the actual SODA API, but we'll just use the fixed CSV for now.
